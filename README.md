# 42 C++ Projects

Welcome to the repository for the C++ projects from the School 42 curriculum. This repository contains various projects designed to teach and reinforce C++ programming concepts through practical applications. Each project aims to develop different aspects of C++ programming and system design.

## Overview

The C++ curriculum at School 42 is divided into several modules, each focusing on different areas of C++ programming, including fundamental concepts, object-oriented programming, templates, memory management, and more. Below is a brief description of the general objectives and topics covered in these projects.

### Projects Included

1. **Introduction to C++**
   - **Objective**: Get acquainted with the basic syntax and structure of C++. Learn fundamental programming concepts and the basics of object-oriented programming.
   - **Key Topics**: Functions, variables, data types, control flow.

2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - **Objective**: Understand and apply OOP principles such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. Dive deeper into constructors, destructors, and encapsulation.
   - **Key Topics**: Classes and objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.

3. **Advanced OOP and Design Patterns**
   - **Objective**: Explore more advanced OOP concepts and design patterns. Implement and understand concepts like operator overloading, abstract classes, and various design patterns.
   - **Key Topics**: Operator overloading, abstract classes, design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory).

4. **Templates and Standard Template Library (STL)**
   - **Objective**: Learn about generic programming using templates and the STL. Understand how to use and implement STL containers, iterators, and algorithms.
   - **Key Topics**: Function and class templates, STL containers (vector, map, set), algorithms.

5. **Memory Management**
   - **Objective**: Gain proficiency in dynamic memory management, including the use of smart pointers and resource management techniques.
   - **Key Topics**: Dynamic memory allocation, smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`), RAII.

6. **File I/O and Serialization**
   - **Objective**: Implement file input/output operations and data serialization techniques to handle data storage and retrieval.
   - **Key Topics**: File streams (`ifstream`, `ofstream`), binary and text file operations, serialization.

7. **Concurrency**
   - **Objective**: Understand and apply multithreading and concurrency concepts in C++. Manage multiple threads and synchronize access to shared resources.
   - **Key Topics**: Threads (`std::thread`), mutexes and locks, condition variables.

8. **Networking (Optional)**
   - **Objective**: Explore network programming concepts and implement basic networking protocols for communication between applications.
   - **Key Topics**: Socket programming, TCP/IP, client-server communication.
